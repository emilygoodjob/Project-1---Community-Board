Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Required Features:
[x] Create a unique theme for events or resources relevant to a specific community
[x] Display at least 10 unique resources or events in a responsive card format
Stretch Features:
[x] Add buttons or links to a related resource on each card component
[x] Make the site responsive for both desktop and mobile formats
